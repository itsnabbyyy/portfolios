# Waze User Churn Prediction 
## Project Overview
This project is based on a scenario from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn for Waze, a popular navigation app.
By identifying factors contributing to user churn, Waze aims to improve user retention and grow its business. In addition, this project aims to demonstrates my skills in project planning, data analysis, machine learning, and business communication within the context of a real-world scenario.

## Objectives
- Analyze user data to understand churn patterns
- Develop a machine learning model to predict user churn
- Identify key factors contributing to user churn
- Provide insights to help Waze optimize its retention strategy

## Project Phases
- Project Planning and Proposal
- Data Inspection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Development and Testing
- Results Analysis and Presentation

## Tools 
- Python for data analysis and machine learning
- Hypothesis testing for establishing relationships between key variables

## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into user churn patterns
- A reliable machine learning model for predicting user churn
- Actionable recommendations for improving user retention
